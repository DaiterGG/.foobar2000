After its release, lead singer Amir Shoat and bassist John Acker, together with the guitarist Shachaf Barkai, formed a side project called \"הפרפר המכני\" (Haparpar Hamechani = The Mechanic Butterfly) which was in techno style. The project was short-lived, and came to its end after the release of their first and only single, \"המשיח הגיע\" (HaMashiach Hegi'a = Messiah Is Here), with one of its two versions featuring opera singer [a2280800] as guest vocalist.\r\n\r\nAfter Infected Mushroom broke up, Shoat, Acker and Barkai relocated to London and reformed the band under the shortened name \"Infected\". Their only album under that incarnation, called \"Breathe\", came out in 1996.\r\n\r\nIn 2001, \"Don't Panic\" was rereleased on CD through Fact Records.\r\n\r\nThe famous trance duo [a14602] \"borrowed\" its name from the band, so they're sometimes referred as \"Infected Mushroom (The Original)\" to prevent confusion between the two groups.", "namevariations": ["Infected"], "aliases": [{"id": 6752991, "name": "גוסטבוס", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/6752991", "thumbnail_url": ""}], "members": [{"id": 775338, "name": "Amir Shoat", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/775338", "active": true, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.discogs.com/oEttUSjGygscgzQzLcXDYVCj8lOcJpO8_KuPgfYG-vI/rs:fit/g:sm/q:40/h:450/w:600/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9BLTc3NTMz/OC0xNTIyNzc4MTI4/LTQyMTAuanBlZw.jpeg"}, {"id": 6507200, "name": "Shay Miara", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/6507200", "active": true, "thumbnail_url": ""}, {"id": 11405105, "name": "Yonathan \"John\" Acker", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/11405105", "active": true, "thumbnail_url": ""}, {"id": 11405108, "name": "Asaf Avramovich", "resource_url": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/11405108", "active": true, "thumbnail_url": ""}], "data_quality": "Needs Vote"}
